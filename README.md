# Authentication System

I made an authentication system using react & express and a bunch of libraries like bcrypt, jsonwebtoken etc.

## Description
This is a full-stack project. Here I have included some features like: 
1. User Authentication
2. Input of Data (Asset Data)
3. Operations on that data 

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/BiswayanPaul/Authentication.git
```

Go to the Backend directory

```bash
  cd server
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm start
```

Go to the Frontend directory

```bash
  cd ..
  cd client
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run dev
```

## Create a .env file inside the server directory
```bash
MONGO_URL = Your MongoDB connection string
JWT_SECRET = Your JWT secret
```
